A metropolitan transportation authority is putting in a system for commuter passes. The city
has several modes of transport: bus, subway, commuter rail, and a special bus used only by the 
elderly. A vending machine distributes the passes. The passes may be bought for monthly unlimited
use or money can be placed on the pass and traveler will be charged per ride. Each mode of 
transport has a different base monthly price. Students and the elderly get a 50% discount for both
the individual rides and for the monthly pass. In the future, the base prices and the discounts
for either students or the elderly (or both) may change. The cost of the monthly pass is pro-rated:
after the 15th of the month, the price is halved. Weekend individual ride prices are 75% of the
weekday base prices. Transportation workers will be issued a special pass that lets them
get on any mode of transport for free. In the future, the system will need to support different
prices for single rides on trains and subway based on length of trip.
